Explain what is special about the database user root. Why root user should always have a strong password?
Why remote login should always be disabled for root user?
Explain how to disable remote login from root user.

User root has all privileges to the database. Thus a strong password is required. A malicious user can do anything in
with the database if they get a root access, including stealing users' personal data (case vastaamo) or destroying
all the data.

When remote login is disabled, a malicious user can't access the database remotely. Logging in to the database works 
only from the machine the database is running. To disable root login, run following commands from the SQL prompt:

DELETE FROM mysql.user 
WHERE User='root' AND Host NOT IN ('localhost', '127.0.0.1', '::1');

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
